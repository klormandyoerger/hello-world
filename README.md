# hello-world

My name is Kristen. I am a crafter, a baker, a gamer, a mother, a wife, a writer. A Jill-of-all-Trades. I am currently making yogurt and trying to keep my child from hurting himself by falling on our hardwood floors. My favorite color is green, my favorite smell is white tea, and my favorite flower is the tulip.
